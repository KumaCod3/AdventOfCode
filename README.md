# Pucchosa-AoC

## Advent of Code 2022 in **Java** (and 2021)

Hi, I'm learning **Java** and I decided to try to participate in the Advent of Code 2022.
I decided to add a GUI, and then I decided to put AoC 2022 and 2021 together, so I'm implementing my old solutions inside my new GUI....
So, I have all the solutions for 2022 and some for 2021 (I won't go back to complete them).

If anyone is interested in trying it:

Download the AoC2022.exe file
Download the logPN.png file
Keep them in the same folder...

RUN!

You can choose the year, day and part,
Paste your input as it is on the Advent of Code page
click Calculate!

You will (should) get the right result!
