# Pucchosa-AoC

## Advent of Code 2022 in **Java** (and 2021)

Hi, I'm learning **Java** and I decided to try to participate in the Advent of Code 2022.
I decided to add a GUI, and then I decided to put AoC 2022 and 2021 together, so I'm implementing my old solutions inside my new GUI....
So, I have all the solutions for 2022 and some for 2021 (I won't go back to complete them).

If anyone is interested in trying it the simple way:
=Download the AoC2022.exe file
=Download the logPN.png file
=Keep them in the same folder...
=RUN!

Or if you prefer the long way:
=Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) if you haven't already done so. You can download the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website.
=Extract the downloaded project files to a folder on your computer.
=Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the project folder using the 'cd' command.
=The main class of this project is src/program.Main
=Compile the Java source code files in the project folder and its subfolders. To do this, use the command: javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/program/Main.java
=Run the application by executing the command: java -cp bin program.Main
ENJOY!
