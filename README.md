## Advent of Code 2022 in **Java** ###(and 2021)

Hi, I'm learning **Java** and I decided to try to participate in the Advent of Code 2022.
So far I'm setting things up, but as I was doing this, I decided to add a GUI, and then I decided to put together 2022 and 2021 AoC, so I'm implementing my old solutions inside my new GUI....
If someone at my same java level can be interested, or if someone better than me wants to suggest some correction I'll be glad!
